To run this big convoluted thing set up your hyperparameters in master_hyper_setup.py and then run it. Make sure all 
metatrader terminals you're going to use have the history downloaded for whatever currency pair your training on. 

master_hyper_setup.py automatically runs mamamamaster.bat which first runs delete_files.py and then runs
big_master_backtests_generator.py {} <- hyperparameter.txt agrument for getting the right parameters. After this it runs
start /wait "" "master_batch_file.bat" which splits off into the (three) metatrader applications for generating backtests.
Once these backtests are done this process is finished and if back_or_live==0 it runs golf_analysis.py {} <- same thing (not
sure why...) and then runs final_analysis.py. If back_or_live == 1 it doesn't run golf_analysis.py because it doesn't have
any fore data. Instead it goes straight to live_analysis.py (not final_analysis.py). final_analysis.py spits out the item
and score number of the best performing rolling back/fore tests in final_ea_params.txt in the back folder. live_analysis.py
spits out the final ea params in final_ea_params.txt in the live folder.

golf_analysis.py should work for india version as well because they output the same data (lists of trade returns - as
opposed to all the trading stats which versions foxtrot and hotel return).

Somewhere in this system expert advisers get copied from the first metatrader instance to the others for very very nice
convenience!

Also, a parameters.txt file is printed into each set# file so you know what parameters where used to generate all those
results.

If you're live testing (back_or_live == 1) it's stupid to do more than 1 backtest...
